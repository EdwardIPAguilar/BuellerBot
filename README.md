### Prerequisites

Mac OS (Not yet tested on others!)

### Setting Up Blackhole For Source Audio Intake
One of the cool things about BuellerBot is that it can take in source audio, that way you don't need to worry about audio feedback during meetings. It can do this by using the blackhole download, which you can get here for free: https://existential.audio/blackhole/

  - Once you've downloaded blackhole (make sure it's the 2ch version), you'll need to setup a MIDI multi-output device. This is super easy on MacOS.

  - All you've got to do is open the 'Audio MIDI setup' app, click on the plus button on the bottom right-hand corner, click multi-output-device, and then be sure to select blackhole + any other devices you want your audio output to route to. Viola, audio device created!

  - Now, to make sure that audio is actually getting passed through to blackhole as well as your other output devices, be sure to right click on the newly created output device on the menu on the left-side and select 'use this device for sound output'

  - Sometimes, you might not see anything showing up when transcribing, the most likely cause is that you haven't selected 'use this device for sound output'. This resets every now and again if you're frequently connecting and disconnecting the output devices it relies on. 

P.S. Input is typically handled within the platform you're using. 

### Connecting BuellerBot To Your ElevenLabs + OpenAI Account
All you've got to do here is create your .env file, and set EL_API_KEY and OPEN_AI_KEY to = your api keys :)
